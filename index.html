                        <p>Hi! My name is Tim.  I am a Validation Engineer that works for a small consulting firm in Pennsylvania.  Currently I am supporting project work at Johnson & Johnsons's Fort Washington Facility.  My day-to-day requires me to verify that the equipment used to produce and package Children's Tylenol, Children's Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Motrin meet federal and corporate regulatory requirements.  Each of the formulas require testing and development to determine optimal run condtions to maximize output while maintaing safety.  When I am not at work, I enjoy listening to and playing music.  Though far from an expert, I am a proficient drummer, my areas of focus in paying being improv jazz and progressive rock.</p>
